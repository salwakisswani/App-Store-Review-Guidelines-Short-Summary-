# Short-Summary
App Store Review Guidelines

Apple seeks to create a new and safe app community where it follows the regulations of 5 topics; 
Safety, Performance, Business, Design, and Legal. 
As they don’t have a completele set of rules, they believe that their rules and 
regulations will constantly be updated based on the quotation of a superimposed court judge, 
“I’ll know it when I see it”. 
Therefore, apple guidelines will constantly be developed and improved. 
Attempts to cheat the system (for example, by trying to trick the review process, steal user data, 
copy another developer’s work, manipulate ratings or App Store discovery) those apps will be removed 
from the store based on the current regulations that seeks to build a safe and honest app development community, 
and new apps presenting new questions may result in new rules at any time.
